# CTF Challenges for Disobey 2025

Some of the challenges have a physical side with hardware provided by me. The plan is to have the hardware at the hacklab area in the community village, but it would be nice to have a backup option for placing them at the CTF area. The hardware should fit on one approx 200x80 cm table, requires approx 8 power outlets with minimal power consumption and having at least 2 chairs for the players at the table would be nice.
