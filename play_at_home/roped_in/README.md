# Roped in

## Description

We have stolen some development files and a prototype from Kouvosto Telecom. Apparently they are developing a SUCKS v2 with improved security due to non executable stack and ram. Can you make sense about this?

Physical boards with USB uart (38400 baud, 8N1) are available near the CTF desk.

The aim was to get the real flag out of the physical systems by exploiting the bad code.
